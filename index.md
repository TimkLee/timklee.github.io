  <h1> Salutations! </h1>

  I (he/him/il) am a Mechatronics and Machine Learning engineer with with diverse experiences and interests. This website presents some of the projects I have worked on in the past. Please refer to my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-ko-lee) page for more work experience related information.

<!-- My research explores how to use deep learning and reinforcement learning to develop generalist robots. 
Practical and versatile mechanical engineer with a background in medical device research and development. 
Proficient in executing hardware development and test cycles to optimize performance and usability. 
Recognized consistency in turning ideas to functional prototypes.

I am currently pursuing my PhD in electrical and computer engineering at McGill University and Mila where I work on interdisciplinary research challenges with my colleagues at the Responsible Autonomy and Intelligent Systems Ethics (RAISE Lab). My current research focuses on how we can characterize, identify and mitigate social and ethical failures of machine learning (ML) systems as early as possible in the ML development process. Moreover, I am interested in investigating how these kind of failures reveal themselves in human-ML interactions. Prior to starting my PhD, I co-founded Generation R consulting, a boutique AI ethics consultancy and was a design researcher with Open Roboethics Institute, on full time basis. 

I  studied design methodology during my masters at UBC and developed a novel needs finding technique based on Activity Theory, a well-established social system analysis methodology. In addition, I completed a bachelors in mechanical engineering (mechatronics options) where I completed a number of robotics-related internships. 

I am currently the executive director at the Open Roboethics Institute (ORI), previously Open Roboethics initiative (ORi) which was established in 2012. ORI is a Canadian thinktank focusing on education and public engagement initiatives. To review what ORI has been working on check out our website at www.openroboethics.org.  -->
