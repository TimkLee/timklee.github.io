<b>Type:</b> EECE 518 (Human Interface Technologies) Project 

<b>Year:</b> 2015

<b>Teammates:</b> Sara Maia, Zemeng Wang

<b>Key Skills:</b> Mechatronic System Design; C++; Arduino; Android Studio

<b>Additional Information:</b> [Sara Maia's Personal Website](https://www.saramaia.me/legacy)

<b>Objectives:</b>
- To investigate the elements that drive human being to bond to a device. 
- To create an add-on device that will mimics a real horse through various sensory input and the corresponding feedback. 

<b>Summary: </b>
<br>Worked on this project with two other classmates. I primarily focused on designing and developing the electrical and mechanical add-on system while the others focused on developing a software that runs on an Android OS and conducting in-depth literature review. We conducted human subject studies to determine the effectiveness of different behaviour of the device.  
- The system mainly consists of a cell phone, three servo motors, and a micro-controller. The software uses the phone’s sensors such as the touchscreen, the microphone, and the accelerometer to generate the corresponding response and sends the command to the micro-controller. The micro-controller then controls the servo-motor to perform the preassigned gestures such as nodding its “head”. 
- Researched and discussed the methods to achieve the objectives and determine the critical feedback that should be included based on interviews with horse riders. 
- Designed and assembled circuitry that connects three servo motors with the micro-controller. • Programmed the Arduino micro-controller to control the movement of the servo motors and interface with the software on the phone. 
- Designed and constructed mechanical fixtures to attach all the components onto a regular bicycle.
