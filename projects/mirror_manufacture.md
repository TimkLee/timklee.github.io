<b>Type:</b> Master’s Research Project

<b>Year:</b> 2014-2015


<b>Key Skills:</b> Mechatronic System Design; Matlab; C#; Micro-controller; Solidworks; Instrumentation; Control Theory; Thermodynamics; Manufacturing Process Development


<b>Objectives:</b>
- To investigate and design a noval process of manufacturing large telescope mirrors. 

<b>Summary: </b>
<br>As my Master’s degree research project, I worked on this solely by myself under the joint supervision of the company sponsoring the project and my professor. 
- Researched the current methods and procedures of manufacturing large telescope mirrors. 
- Studied the behaviour and properties of various different glass and high temperature material. 
- Conducted experiments with a theoretical manufacturing process called slumping. In this process, a thin sheet of glass is supported by the edge and placed within a furnace. The furnace is held at the annealing temperature of the glass for a certain duration to allow the glass to deform due to its own weight. The system is then cooled down slowly back to room temperature. 
- Conducted various slumping experiments. Measured the test pieces using a laser measurement device and processed the data using Matlab. 
- Designed a large furnace capable of slumping glass up to eight meters with localized heating capability. Developed a method of measuring the surface of the glass during the process. The method uses lasers and relies on the reflection of the glass to determine the slope of the surface. 
- Modelled all components using SolidWorks. 
- Specified the components required based on heat transfer calculation, components limitation, strength calculation, and the designed measurement method. 
- Presented the design for the circuitry and outlined a theoretical method of controlling the system. • Proposed an alternative manufacturing procedures based on test results and updated requirements. Created a general concept of how the new system would be constructed.
