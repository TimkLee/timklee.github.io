<b>Type:</b> MECH 423 (Mechatronic Product Design) Project 

<b>Year:</b> 2012

<b>Teammates:</b> Iftikhar Azam

<b>Key Skills:</b> C#; Arduino; Solidworks; Prototyping

<b>Additional Information:</b> [Demonstration Video](https://youtu.be/UXrYXhtCI5I )

<b>Objectives:</b>
- To create a robotic hand that mimics the movement of the userâ€™s fingers in real-time using uses a glove as the control interface. In addition, the system plays a corresponding sound note based on the finger moved. 

<b>Summary: </b>
<br>Worked on all aspects of the project together with my teammate.
- Generated the concept of the design and the approach. 
- Assembled the control glove by sewing flex sensors onto a regular glove. 
- Constructed the mechanical hand using recycled prototype materials as the structure and straws and strings as the fingers. 
- Mounted the five servo motors to the mechanical hand structure as the drive system. 
- Programmed the Arduino micro-controller to receive, process, and output various signals. 
- Constructed and assembled circuitry to connect all the components. 
- Programmed a C# application that communicates with the micro-controller and plays the corresponding sound note when the signal is detected.
