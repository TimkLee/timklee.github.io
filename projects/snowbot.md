<b>Type:</b> University Student Team (Thunderbird Robotics) Project

<b>Year:</b> 2008-2009

<b>Teammates:</b> Ian, Ash, Matt, Tom, Marcel

<b>Key Skills:</b> C; C++; Micro-controller; Insturmentation; Computer Vision 

<b>Additional Information:</b> [IARRC Website](https://robotracing.wordpress.com/)

<b>Objectives:</b>
- To create a fully autonomous vehicle capable of traversing a race track with obstacles. 
- To participate in the 2009 International Autonomous Robot Racing Challenge (IARRC) hosted by the University of Waterloo.

<b>Summary: </b>
<br>The team consisted of six members. Each built their own robot using the same base components and code. Different methods were used to modify each individual robot for the race. The final iteration of the robot we used for the competition relied solely on the vision system for navigation. Specifically, I:  
- Modified the remote-controlled car chassis to be the robot base frame. Constructed simple components for structural reinforcement. 
- Modified regular webcams into wide-angle cameras using a peephole lens. 
- Assembled and installed electrical components and sensors such as micro-controller board, servo motors, H-bridge, sonar sensors, etc. 
- Assisted in programming the custom microcontroller designed and constructed by another team member using C. 
- Modified the base AI program developed by another team member using the onboard Ubuntu Linux laptop.
