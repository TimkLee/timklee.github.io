<b>Type:</b> Industry Research Project 

<b>Year:</b> 2013

<b>Key Skills:</b> C++; Matlab; Agilent Vee; Micro-controller, Instrumentation 

<b>Additional Information:</b> [Building Performance Analysis](https://www.bcit.ca/building-science-centre-of-excellence/research-education/research/building-performance-analysis/)

<b>Objectives:</b>
- To create a device that simulates the heat, humidity, and carbon dioxide generated by an average living person for building science related research. 


<b>Summary: </b>
<br>Modified the existing design, purchased the necessary components, assembled, programmed, and tested the system. The system mainly consists of a water reservoir with ultrasonic humidifier, heat lamps, a carbon dioxide dispenser, and a peristaltic pump. All the components are connected to a micro-controller that communicates with a control software on a laptop. 
- Reviewed and modified the initial design and purchased the additional components required. â€¢ Planned, assembled and connected all the components into a metal box. 
- Programmed the ADAM micro-controller. Communication between the different devices uses the RS 232 and RS-485 protocol. 
- Programmed the control software using Agilent Vee. 
- Prepared several test plans and created a C# program that communicates with a digital scale to test and debug the system.
