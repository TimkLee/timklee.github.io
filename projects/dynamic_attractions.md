<b>Objectives:</b>
- To deliver entertainment systems that fulfill the client’s requirements and exceeds their expectations. 

<b>Summary: </b>
<br>The projects at Dynamic Attractions involve multiple stages with experts from various backgrounds. Due to the nature of the projects, they requires several multidisciplinary teams to develop the complex machineries and deliver the final system. I have worked on various stages in different projects. 
- Participated in identifying the system requirements and functionality. Created and reviewed design documents such as FMEA and hazard analysis. 
- Worked on the initial designs and modelling of several mechanical devices and structures using AutoCad Inventor. Reviewed and red-lined drawings produced by the drafting department. 
- Calculated the required specification or component’s life on various mechanical components such as bearings and motors. Analyzed structural components using Ansys. Reviewed pneumatic and hydraulic drawings prepared by sub-contractors. 
- Assisted the production department in resolving manufacturing challenges and communicated with sub-contractors to provide additional information and propose solutions. 
- Designed, manufactured, and created prototypes to prove the functionality of the device and identify potential improvements. Designed and programmed the PLC for various tests. 
- Prepare test plans for both factory acceptance test and site acceptance test. 
- Prepared and reviewed design and analysis documents prior to releasing them to the clients and the third party reviewers.
- Managed and advised workers on-site during installation. 
- Conducted tests, such as accelerometer test and components failure test, during on-site commissioning to identify issues and derive solutions accordingly. Record difficulties encountered and areas of improvement. 
- Worked with creative teams and other client’s sub-contracts to program the motion of the robots and theming installation. 
- Trained and guided maintenance technicians and operation personnel in maintaining and operating the ride system.
