<b>Type:</b> Industry Project 

<b>Year:</b> 2014-2015

<b>Key Skills:</b> C++; Matlab; Robotics; Instrumentation; Manufacturing Process Development

<b>Objectives:</b>
- To develop a new method of manufacturing large telescope mirror through the use of industrial robots. 
- To achieve submillimetric profile accuracy.

<b>Summary: </b>
<br>This was a side project conducted in conjunction to working on my Masterâ€™s project. The company wished to confirm the feasibility and develop the capability of using an industrial robotic arm to grind and polish large telescope mirrors. 
- The system primarily consists of a Kuka robot arm, a spindle, and a VFD for the spindle. 
- Researched the current methods and procedures on glass grinding and polishing. 
- Identified and specified the additional components required such as the VFD, diamond cutting tools, polishing pads, etc. Communicated with suppliers to learn about potential alternatives. 
- Modelled and created the drawings of several adapters and tools using SolidWorks. 
- Constructed and assembled the mechanical system and the electrical system. 
- Programmed the Kuka robot and generated the desired tool path using Matlab. 
- Designed and conducted tests to determine the performance of the system. 
- Designed and constructed a simplified coordinate-measuring machine using the robot arm to measure the accuracy of the generated surface.
